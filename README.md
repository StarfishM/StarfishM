## Hi there, I am Merle ✨

These days I am a software engineer focusing on backend in the cloud, but still dabbling in the front whenever opportunity arises. I am very passionate about knowing, and understanding why things function the way they do, and I deeply care about learning, and building, which best happens as a collaborative process, than all by your lonesome.

### Me in a 🌰🐚
- ☁️ I hang out in the cloud (aws, azure, ...)
- 👩‍🏫 I used to teach at a coding bootcamp in Berlin, making sure coding newbies didn't sink but confidently learned how to keep afloat, and ultimately how to swim in this ocean of code.
- 🛠 I know how to JavaScript/TypeScript, Node (Express), Go, React, Vue, Postgres, Redis, Jest, etc.
- 🌱 I want to learn more about Design Patterns, and dig deeper into TypeScript.
- 💬 Ask me about how to learn how to code, and organise backyard movie theaters.
- 📬 reach me via [📧 email](mailto:mer.fischer+ghprofile@gmail.com) or find me on [🕵️‍♀️ linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/merle-fischer/)
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡️ Fun facts: I like to capture the world on analogue film, and know how to ride a unicycle.
